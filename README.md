## Project Description:
This project contains a Trading Website and a Steam chat/trading bot. The website allows a user to buy and sell Steam items with the help of a "SteamBot" which is a chat and trading automated Steam account that will add the user on Steam and carry out trades and communication. This project can carry out the following functions:

## Allows a user to login to website with Steam account

This login page will redirect the user to a Steam login authtentication page. The user can then sign into their Steam account. This will then create a profile on the website. This login allows the website READ access to the users Steam account. Therefore it can display inventory items, and many other details such as Steam profile information. 

## Allows a user to sell their Steam items in return for credits.
